Certainly! Here's a template for a README file for your S3-like service assignment:

S3-Like Service
This is a simple Node.js-based service that offers basic operations similar to Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). It allows you to create buckets and manage objects within those buckets. The service is designed to mimic key functionalities of AWS S3 without actually using AWS services.

Features
Create Buckets: You can create buckets to organize your objects.
Create Objects: Store objects within buckets.
Get Objects: Retrieve objects from a specific bucket.
Delete Objects: Remove objects from a bucket.
List Objects: List objects within a bucket.
List Buckets: List all available buckets.

Install the required dependencies:

Start the server:
npm start


Following are the checks and assumption:

-No duplicate buckets can be created.
-Objects are stored within existing buckets.
-Duplicate keys within the same bucket are prevented.
-Objects can be retrieved, updated, or deleted based on their key.
-Errors are handled gracefully and meaningful error messages are returned.



API Endpoints
Create a Bucket:

POST /api/s3/buckets
Create an Object:


POST /api/s3/objects/:bucket
Get an Object:


GET /api/s3/objects/:bucket/:key
Delete an Object:


DELETE /api/s3/objects/:bucket/:key
List Objects in a Bucket:


GET /api/s3/objects/:bucket
List Buckets:


GET /api/s3/buckets
Update an Object:


PUT /api/s3/objects/:bucket/:key
Authentication (Optional)
This service supports JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. You can register and log in users to receive a token. To access the S3-like service routes, users can include the JWT token in the request's authorization header (commonly as a bearer token).

Dependencies
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB (for storing buckets and objects)
Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction)
bcrypt or scrypt (for password hashing, depending on your choice)
jsonwebtoken (for JWT authentication)
